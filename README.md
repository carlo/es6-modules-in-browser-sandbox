## ES6 w/ modules w/o transpiling to ES5

I want to prototype browser code using ES6. I don't want the code to be compiled
to ES5. I want to use ES6 modules, though. This little repo does exactly that: I
set up [Rollup](http://rollupjs.org/) with a few plugins to leave the ES6 code
alone while adding a wafer-thin layer to deal with modules (my own and those in
`node_modules/`).

Remember, the entire thing is targetted at prototyping stuff in ES6-capable
browsers. For good measure the HTML page includes the right polyfills for the
currently active browser, c/o [polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io/v2/docs/).

**THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS.** Also, I might loose interest tomorrow.

So, to recap, this here setup â€¦

- scratches an itch of mine
- lets me write ES6
- lets me use ES6 modules
- hands the ES6 code to the browsers without transpiling it to ES5 first
- gives me source maps in Chrome et al
- is based on Rollup, (very) few plugins and a bit of duct tape


### Why?

Because [browser support for ES6](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/) is
pretty solid by now.  Not perfect, but we're getting there.  I understand why
it's highly advised to compile ES6 code to ES5 for production use -- but for
simple prototyping and tinkering I don't want that anymore.


### Setup

Running node 6, just do a `npm install` to set up the dependencies.

Do a `npm run start`, then open `http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html` in your
browser and check its Web Inspector.


### npm tasks

- `start`: **main task**, runs `build` task once, then starts HTTP server and
  FS watcher
- `build:html`: copies all HTML files in `src/` to `dist/`
- `build:js`: generates the JS bundle in `dist/`
- `build`: runs all available build tasks
- `serve`: fires up `http-server` on port 8080
- `watch:html`: continuously listens for changes in HTML files and triggers
  `build:html` task
- `watch:js`: continuously listens for changes in JS files and triggers the
  `build:js` task
- `watch`: runs all available watch tasks
