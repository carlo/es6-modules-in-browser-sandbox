### ES6 w/ modules w/o transpiling to ES5

A little ES6 sandbox template which â€¦

- scratches an itch of mine
- lets me write ES6
- lets me use ES6 modules
- hands the ES6 code to the browsers without transpiling it to ES5 first
- gives me source maps in Chrome et al
- is based on Rollup, (very) few plugins and a bit of duct tape

Check the Web Inspector.
